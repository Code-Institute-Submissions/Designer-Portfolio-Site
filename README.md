### Context

As technology evoles, it is essential for designers to have a portfolio site to showcase their works, be it to the employers or someone who is looking for a freelancer. Hence, this is a porfolio website created for myself to showcase the best works of design projects I have worked on so far.

### UX/UI 

## Information Structure

This is a one page website. Informations are organised in sections and flow down through the page, with the sequence as follows:
- Home
- My Works
- About
- Contact

# Home
The page starts with a greeting and short introduction with an illustration as a symbol of myself

# My Works__
This is a section where user can see my design works, with description of each artwork about

# About
A more in-depth introduction on my skills set, software knowledge and education background

# Contact
A contact form to enable user to drop me a message in case they need a collaboration

Information is structured in this way to cater to the audience needs. Usually for a designer, people would like to see their works before seeing their biography. After finding out more about this person, then they will decide whether to contact or not.

## Navigation

The navigation is designed possible in two ways, first is through conventional scroll down, and another way is through direct clicking the nav bar. As this is a long page full of contents, to ease the navigation of each section, the navigation bar is fixed on the left side of the page (for desktop version), and expandable on top  (for mobile version). While user choose to navigate the page though the conventional way of scrolling down, the nav bar will show the section that the user is current in. 

## Use of Colours
Bright and vibrant colours are selected in this design to capture audience attention. 

The colour pallete:
